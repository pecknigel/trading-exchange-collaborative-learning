# Trading Exchange Collaborative Learning Program

This repo is an umbrella for the Trading Exchange Collaborative Learning Program from Prescription Free.

It includes general information and documentation related to the program, along with links to the individual repos.

Resources can go here that apply to the program in general. It’s not intended for code, but could be used for some general scripts in the future.

It’s the starting point if you’re looking for something.
